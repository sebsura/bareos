/*
 * Generic accurate payload is the same for any storage class.
 *
 * We store the lstat field as a character field as it makes storing of the
 * data much more efficient than storing it in a normal stat structure.
 * Nowadays most of these structures are 64 bits and they will use 136
 * bytes (32 bits) and 128 bytes (64 bits) on Solaris. The ASCII encoding
 * of the lstat field most of the time is between 43 and 75 bytes with an
 * average of 60 bytes. (From live data of 152562393 files.)
 *
 * The seen flag is not in the actual accurate payload but stored in a
 * bitmap. This makes it much more efficient for a storage engine that has
 * to update the whole data when something changes. For things like a in
 * memory hash table it doesn't make much difference and it has the
 * disadvantage that we need to keep a filenr to index the bitmap which
 * also cost some bytes.
